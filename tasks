now i want to add RAG subsytem. create technical specification for it.

## Introduce RAG and GraphRAG sub-system
I want you to introduce the RAG component.
i want it be able to create a vector database from the givven path
using https://github.com/chonkie-inc/chonkie.
I want to use local vector database and local graph database.
during the indexation(making the vectors) i want the command which index the documents
also setup the connections between vectors, documents and other entities which be introduced.
before making chunks I want the command clean the text from the rudiments by using the cheap LLM.
each vector should contain the mera information:
 - for tickets it's attributes (like number, creator, assigner, component etc
 - for source code see <INDEXING_SOURCE_CODE> for details

<INDEXING_SOURCE_CODE>
when indexing the source code it should follow the algorithm
- use ask to parse the code
- for each item send it to llm and ask to explain what it does and what it is in 2-3 sentences
- use that text for making vectors
- dependecies should be in the vector metadata and in graphDB
- in metadata should be path to the file
</INDEXING_SOURCE_CODE>

then I want to use the vector search for context building during the reasoning step.
it's also OK if some agents want to build separate context with RAG and GraphRAG for its work - that means that RAG should be use for building main context and each agent could use RAG for building own context which needs to be send to llm
