could you please update /clauding command do not stop implementation with questions "whould you like me to continue...", always continue! till the very end or user interaption. and another thing is please update roadmap Phase 9. I whould like that there be integration and functional tests. and also update CLAUDE.md regarding the functional and integration tests, I don't need as much tests as possible, I actually need one acceptance test which cover the main functionality of the task.
