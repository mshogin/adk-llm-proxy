/think I want to create a road map.
  0. add support of MCP servers: I want to create a module which could work with MCP servers defined in the config file 
  1. add support of implementing MCP servers in this project: have a directory mcps, in this directory be directories each of 
  them is a independent mcp server
  2. add MCP for integration with YouTrack: as a user I want to get dinamic of the epic implementation, like find epic, find 
  all tasks inside this epic, get the statuses, comments. analize all info and prepare the current status and what happend for
   the last week: some tasks closes, some task opens. 
  2. add MCP for integration with GitLab to get more info for #1: like analize code which was done and how it relates to the 
  epic and tasks
  3. implement MCP server for building rag (vector and graph) by givven folder
  4. proxy will be working with MCP like: in preprocessing, reasoning or postprocessing if there is a sub-task to do, proxy 
  collect available tools from all mcp, send the sub-task and tools to LLM and ask which tool is the best to resolve the 
  sub-task

  so create a step-by-step roadmap with check boxes near each step. 
  IMPORTANT, each should be implementable, I'm going to ask you(cloude code) to implement each step incrementaly. so write the
   steps in a way you feel it is best for you to understand the task
